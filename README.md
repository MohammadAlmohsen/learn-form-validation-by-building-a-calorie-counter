# learn form validation by building a calorie counter
 In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.



In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.
